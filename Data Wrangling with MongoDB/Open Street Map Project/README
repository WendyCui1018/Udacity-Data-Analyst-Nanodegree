Notice
*************************************************************************************************************
1. Whole dataset I used is a part of Los Angeles map, which was extracted on website MapZen. I chose Los Angeles because I am a student of UCLA who wants to know more about this city. The reason why I extracted a part of it is that the whole map of Los Angeles is around 8G, which is hard to use my own computer to finish the task. However, the region I chose includes UCLA and some busy areas;so I think it can be a representative of Los Angeles.

3. The sample data in this folder is too small to show all the problems I found with the data I extracted, so when running audit.py, some of the results may be empty.
